Hi I'm Sam from Marseille.<br>
If you are here, it's because you are lost on internet nor you know me.
This place is where I talk about my internet experience as a //web developer// (who wants to become sysadmin)
</p>

<p>
This website's purpose is to share my passion to anyone who has the will to read my articles.
</p>

#I will talk about:
- Web development (//php//,//WAMP//,//Symfony//)
- //Arduino// and //Raspberry Pi//
- My journey to build a new PC
- The challenges I've done on /a:codewars.com:Codewars/
- My Vim tricks/ressources
- Some ressources
- Maybe some tutorials if I consider myself good enought

<p>I hope you'l have a good time learning or just inspiring yourself on this website.<br>
Good reading fellow coder.
Seeya on the web !
